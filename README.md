# Generating Fashion Image Data with Variational Autoencoders

Implemented Variational Autoencoders with convolutional layers on the FashionMNIST dataset using Pytorch. Model was successfully able to generate within-category and cross-category images. Visualizations were provided with t-SNE embedding. 

Run the vae-cnn Jupyter Notebook to obtain results, skipping the cell on model training to use the trained model provided.
